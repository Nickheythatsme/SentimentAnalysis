I babysit for my cousin a lot and when her kid was really little, she used to come out of her bedroom in the middle of the night while I was in the living room watching a movie on my laptop and every time she'd scare the shit out of me when I saw her lurking in the doorway in silence. Usually she was so sleepy and just wondering if her mother was home yet, so I could quietly lead her back to bed and tuck her in and tell her her mum would be back in the morning, but it was SUPER creepy when she'd just stand in the doorway with the dark hallway behind her, look at me, then slowly walk back to bed and go back to sleep. Like wtf u doin, kiddo!
